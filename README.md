# web_scraping
This project was created by me with help from my tutor Kourt, AskBCS and Google. It is information scraped from two websites about Mars. 
The first is scraping is scraped titles and teaser info from a Mars new article.
The second is data obtained from a Mars table about weather.
It includes a csv file for the ouput of the DataFrame that was created from the Mars weather table.
